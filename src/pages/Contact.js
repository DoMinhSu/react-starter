            Piedmont, or mountain, glaciers are found in many parts of the world. <br />
            In North America they are distributed along the mountain ranges of the Pacific Coast from central California northward. <br />
            They abound in the Andes range in South America and are familiar and greatly admired spectacles in the Alps, the Pyrenees, the Caucasus Mountains and the mountains of Scandanavia. <br />
            Rivers of ice flow down the valleys of various Asian mountain ranges, including the Himalayas, the Hindu Kush, and the Karakoram and Kunlun ranges. <br />
            They are also a feature of the Southern Alps of New Zealand and are found in the lofty mountains of New Guinea. <br />
            The largest piedmont glaciers are the Malaspina and Bering glaciers, both in Alaska.<br />
